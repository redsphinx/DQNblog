### Cartesius

For this project I run all programs on the [Dutch national supercomputer](https://userinfo.surfsara.nl/systems/cartesius) called Cartesius. You need a [SURFsara](https://www.surf.nl/en/about-surf/subsidiaries/surfsara) account to be able to do this. 

I logged into my account on Cartesius and cloned a [Theano-based implementation of Deep Q-Learning](https://github.com/spragunr/deep_q_rl):

```
ssh username@doornode.surfsara.nl
git clone https://github.com/spragunr/deep_q_rl
cd deep_q_rl
```

Now we are inside the `deep_q_rl/` directory which has all the files that we need.
